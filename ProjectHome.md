# Project moved #

This code has moved inside the Chromium repository. It was always designed for Chromium, and now that there is no need to share this code with WebKit (which maintains its own "KURL" code for URLs for the non-Chromium ports), maintaining google-url in a separate repository only added work to make changes.

You can find the code in the "[url](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/url/)" directory of the Chromium source tree.

This site is maintained as a snapshot for historical reasons and to be a handy reference for pre-merge changes.
